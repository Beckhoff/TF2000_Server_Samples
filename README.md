This repository contains server extensions that showcase many features
of the server extension API, as well as various aspects of the
interaction between extensions and the server.

Here is a list of all sample extensions:

- [NetworkTime](Extensions/NetworkTime/)
- [RandomValue](Extensions/RandomValue/)
- [Diagnostics](Extensions/Diagnostics/)
- [InterExtensionCommunication](Extensions/InterExtensionCommunication/)
- [MinimalAuthentication](Extensions/MinimalAuthentication/)
- [CustomUserManagement](Extensions/CustomUserManagement/)
- [EditPermissions](Extensions/EditPermissions/)
- [EventSystem](Extensions/EventSystem/)
- [EventListening](Extensions/EventListening/)
- [ConfigListening](Extensions/ConfigListening/)
- [ComplexConfig](Extensions/ComplexConfig/)
- [CustomConfig](Extensions/CustomConfig/)
- [StaticSymbols](Extensions/StaticSymbols/)
- [DynamicSymbols](Extensions/DynamicSymbols/)
- [StartProcessFromService](Extensions/StartProcessFromService/README.md)
- [ErrorHandling](Extensions/ErrorHandling/)
- [LetsEncrypt](Extensions/LetsEncrypt/)

## Documentation for the .NET extension API

The documentation for the API can be found in the
[Beckhoff Information System](https://infosys.beckhoff.com/index.php?content=../content/1031/te2000_tc3_hmi_engineering/3864419211.html).

## Getting started

Our suggestion is to start with the
[NetworkTime](Extensions/NetworkTime/) or the
[RandomValue](Extensions/RandomValue/) sample.
Both are relatively short but contain many of the most commonly used features:
Registering listeners, handling symbol requests, and storing settings in the
extension configuration.

Every extension can define its own set of error codes. The
[ErrorHandling](Extensions/ErrorHandling/) showcases how this should be
implemented.

The HMI server generates a configuration page for every server extension. If
you want to display additional status information on your extension's
configuration page, have a look at the
[Diagnostics](Extensions/Diagnostics/) sample.

## Advanced samples

### **Authentication**

- [MinimalAuthentication](Extensions/MinimalAuthentication/): If you
want to extend the authentication system of the HMI server, this sample
extension is the best starting point.
- [CustomUserManagement](Extensions/CustomUserManagement/): A more
realistic implementation of a user management extension that supports adding,
removing, renaming, as well as enabling and disabling users.
- [EditPermissions](Extensions/EditPermissions/): An extension that edits
symbol permissions and user groups at runtime.

### **Event system**

- [EventSystem](Extensions/EventSystem/): Use this sample as a
starting point if you want to write an extension that sends messages or raises
alarms.
- [EventListening](Extensions/EventListening/): If your server
extension is going to listen for messages and alarms from other extensions or
the HMI server, take a look at this sample.

### **Miscellaneous**

- [InterExtensionCommunication](Extensions/InterExtensionCommunication/):
This sample will give you an understanding of how multiple extensions can
interact with each other, and with the HMI server.
- [ConfigListening](Extensions/ConfigListening/): If your server
extension wants to listen for changes to its configuration, take a look at this
sample.
- [ComplexConfig](Extensions/ComplexConfig/): A server extension with a complex
configuration schema that showcases how an extension can read and edit its own
extension configuration.
- [CustomConfig](Extensions/CustomConfig/): The HMI server generates a
configuration page for every extension. This sample showcases how this default
page can be replaced with a custom HTML page.
- [StaticSymbols](Extensions/StaticSymbols/): This sample demonstrates how to
automatically generate symbols based on .NET types at compile time.
- [DynamicSymbols](Extensions/DynamicSymbols/): All other samples
provide a fixed list of symbols that clients can use to interact with the
extension. This sample demonstrates how an extension can provide a dynamic list
of symbols that changes at runtime.
- [StartProcessFromService](Extensions/StartProcessFromService/):
Starts a process from a server extension running as a service.
- [LetsEncrypt](Extensions/LetsEncrypt/): This server extension generates
an ssl certificate with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
- [ProtectedSymbol](Extensions/ProtectedSymbol/): Protect and encrypt symbols with the windows [DPAPI](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/standard/security/how-to-use-data-protection).
